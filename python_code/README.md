# Kalman Filter and Particle Filter 

## The folder contains the following python files:

1) Project_KF_3state_simulation_v2.py
- Implementation of Kalman Filter and Control 
feed back framework on simulated sensor data.
- Target state, Initial state can be changed for testing
- On running,Estimated states at each step are displayed in terminal, 
the estimated state would eventually reach the target state
- Displays 3 result analysis plots. Close one plot window to display the next plot window and so on

-----------------------------------------------------------------
2) Project_controlKF_3state_userinput_v2.py 
- Implementation of Kalman Filter and Control feed back framework on real sensor data with user prompt 
- User input required:Target state, Initial displaced state, sensor measurements at each
step. 
- By following the displayed instructions on providing the required data and by following instructions on moving camera, the camera would eventually reach target state.
- Displays 3 result analysis plots. Close one plot window to display the next plot window and so on

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Project_PF_Control_3state_simulation_loop.py
- Implementation of Particle Filter and Control feed back framework on simulated sensor data.
- Target state, Initial state, and Motion and Sensor noise standard deviations can be changed in relevant parts of code.
- On running,Estimated states are displayed in terminal, the estimated state would eventually reach the target state.
- Displays 3 result analysis plots. Close one plot window to display the next plot window and so on.
